# OCLP-MacFusion
Enables Autodesk Fusion to install on Mac OS installations patched with OCLP [OpenCore Legacy Patcher](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/)

This will patch the Autodesk Fusion to installer to bypass the [Mac OS hardware checks](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/Autodesk-Fusion-Unsupported-Mac-Hardware-Configurations.html) introduced in March 2025.

Just run patch.sh (**not** as root!) and then execute the "Install Autodesk Fusion" app on your desktop to install Fusion.
